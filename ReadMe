Spring Boot Assessment

# What did you like about this project?
Very challenging but fun assessment, it about what we learn thoughout the whole bootcamp or almost all.... 

# What did you struggle with in this project?
I was shaking like a leaf when I do testing in the thunder client cause I keep having error, but end up it was because I use https instead of http â€¦

# What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Hope that there would actually be more time allocated to teach us the backend.
